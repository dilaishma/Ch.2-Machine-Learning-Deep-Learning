# Ch.2-Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning

I created this repository to explain my team assignment deliverables chapter 2 â€œMachine Learning and Deep Learning" in MSIB program at Startup Campus

****Assignment 2 case [1]****
**Machine Learning (Supervised: Classification)**

in this case, the task is to predict churn status in banking. After determining three different models, then the three models are compared and summarized which model is the best.

****Assignment 2 case [2]****
**Machine Learning (Unsupervised: Clustering)**

In this case, the task is to determine the best number of clusters from random data points. There is a summary of how many clusters are best for the given data. The best multiple cluster results will be visualized with a seaborn plot.

****Assignment 2 case [3]****
**Deep Learning (Supervised: Regression)**

In this case, the task is to Predict House Prices with Multilayer Perceptron.

****Assignment 2 case [4]****
**Deep Learning (Supervised: Classification)**

In this case, the task is Credit Card Fraud Classification with Multilayer Perceptron. Make sure the model evaluation results are above 95%.
